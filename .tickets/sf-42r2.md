# Multi-backend validation and documentation

End-to-end integration testing and user documentation for multi-backend support.

This story covers integration tests verifying the full multi-backend flow (create backends via mkdir, set URLs via file write, switch default via symlink, verify model directories use the correct backend's client, conversation isolation, compatibility symlinks) and updating the README to document all multi-backend operations.

When complete, the feature is validated end-to-end and documented for users.
