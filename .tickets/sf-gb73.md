# Add comprehensive README.md for GitHub repository

Add a README.md that contains useful information for people checking out the repo and browsing on github: description, installation, link to shelley, etc. Make sure anything from CLAUDE.md that's duplicated with it is cleaned up. If it makes sense to consolidate with fuse/README.md, or to autogenerate fuse/README.md, do that.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. README.md exists at repository root
2. Includes project description, installation instructions, and link to Shelley
3. Content is well-organized and helpful for GitHub visitors
4. No duplicate content between root README.md and CLAUDE.md or fuse/README.md
5. If consolidation makes sense, fuse/README.md is either consolidated or autogenerated from root README
