# Update README for multi-backend

Document the multi-backend feature in fuse/README.md. Cover: creating backends (mkdir), setting URLs (echo to url file), switching default (ln -s), using specific backends (direct path access), checking backend status (test -f connected), removing backends (rmdir, cannot remove default).
