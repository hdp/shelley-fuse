# Document /conversation/{local-id}/archived file

The /conversation/{local-id}/archived file exists in the implementation but is not documented in CLAUDE.md. This is a presence/absence file that shows whether a conversation is archived, and can be created (to archive) or removed (to unarchive) a conversation.
