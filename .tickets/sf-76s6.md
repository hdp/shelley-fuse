# last/N symlink should point directly to message, not a directory

Currently the filesystem has  which is a symlink inside a directory. This should be simplified so that  itself is a symlink directly to the message directory.

Current (incorrect) structure:
  last/N/NNN-{slug} -> ../../..

Desired (correct) structure:
  last/N -> ../../{NNN}-{slug}

This applies to the  path in the FUSE filesystem.
