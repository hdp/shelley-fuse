# last/N symlinks should be ordinal, not named

Current (incorrect) structure:
  last/N/{AAA}-{slug} -> ../../..

Desired (correct) structure:
  last/N/0 -> ../../{AAA}-{slug}
  last/N/1 -> ../../{AAB}-{slug}

e.g. the single last message should be last/1/0 (0th message of the last 1), the 5th message back should be last/5/0, and it should be possible to read the last 5 messages, oldest first, with `cat .../last/5/*/content.md`
