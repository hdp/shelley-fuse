# Remove meta/ directory references from documentation

The CLAUDE.md file mentions a meta/ directory in the filesystem hierarchy that doesn't actually exist. Need to remove these references to prevent confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CLAUDE.md no longer mentions meta/ directory\n2. Filesystem hierarchy documentation accurately reflects the actual implementation
