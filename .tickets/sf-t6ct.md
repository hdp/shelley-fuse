# Update docs for all message restructuring

Update CLAUDE.md filesystem hierarchy and the embedded README.md in filesystem.go to reflect all changes: named message files with tool slugs, boolean present/absent files, messages/count, no from/, fixed since/ semantics.

## Acceptance Criteria

CLAUDE.md and README.md accurately describe the current filesystem layout. No references to removed features.
